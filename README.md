# About This Application
This is an API built to support the front-end Reviews module of a retail product-landing page. The front-end for this application can be viewed [here](http://18.188.132.96:7000/).  

This project was built with Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, and Redis. I deployed this application to AWS via Docker and horizontally scaled to three EC2's, ultimately supporting several thousand requests per second. 

I made a series of videos discussing the specific challenges I faced during this project, which can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/view_all_playlists?nv=1).

This application can be run locally via the following commands:
```
npm install
npm start
```
This will launch the server on localhost:8080.
